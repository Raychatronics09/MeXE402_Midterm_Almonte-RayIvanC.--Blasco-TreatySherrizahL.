## Introduction

Every day, data is collected and stored. These data can help shape the very world we live in whether it makes the world better, makes life better, or can make life and the world more secure and especially, safer. It can also help with predicting outcomes or results whether it be about behavior or risks and that is where Machine Learning can be applied. Machine Learning is the technological advancement that allows computers to learn from data or variables it is given and execute certain tasks it is being asked to do. One of these tasks is being able to predict a certain outcome based on the data or the variables and what the results were based on those. This kind of task is called Regression Analysis wherein there are factors, called the independent variables, that lead to outcomes, called dependent variables. The dependent variable is what the machine is trying to predict based on the numerous independent variables that are factors to that outcome. For this project, there are two kinds of Regression analysis used which are the Linear Regression Analysis and the Logistic Regression analysis. Linear Regression Analysis refers to the relationship between the independent variables and their impact on the dependent variable which is classified to be in continuous nature. 

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for the Linear Regression Analysis is the “Life Expectancy (WHO)” which is a Statistical Analysis of factors influencing Life Expectancy.  
The following variables are contained in the datasheet:
+ ***Country*** - 193 unique entries
+ ***Year*** - Ranging from 2010 to 2015
+ ***Status*** - Developed or Developing status
+ ***Life expectancy*** - Life Expectancy in age
+ ***Adult Mortality*** - Adult Mortality Rates of both sexes (probability of dying between 15 and 60 years per 1000 population)
+ ***Infant deaths*** - Number of Infant Deaths per 1000 population
+ ***Alcohol*** - Alcohol, recorded per capita (15+) consumption (in litres of pure alcohol)
+ ***Percentage expenditure*** - Expenditure on health as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product per capita(%)
+ ***Hepatitis B*** - Hepatitis B (HepB) immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%)
+ ***Measles*** - Measles - number of reported cases per 1000 population
+ ***BMI*** - Average Body Mass Index of entire population
+ ***Under-five deaths*** - Number of under-five deaths per 1000 population
+ ***Polio*** - Polio (Pol3) immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%)
+ ***Total expenditure*** - General government expenditure on health as a percentage of total government expenditure (%)
+ ***Diphtheria*** - Diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%)
+ ***HIV/AIDS*** - Deaths per 1 000 live births HIV/AIDS (0-4 years)
+ ***GDP*** - Gross Domestic Product per capita (in USD)
+ ***Population***
+ ***Thinness 10-19 years*** - Prevalence of thinness among children and adolescents for Age 10 to 19 (%)
+ ***Thinness 5-9 years*** - Prevalence of thinness among children for Age 5 to 9 (%)
+ ***Income composition of resources*** - Human Development Index in terms of income composition of resources (index ranging from 0 to 1)
+ ***Schooling*** - Number of years of Schooling (years)













The dataset used for Logistic Regression Analysis contains customer information from a telecommunication company, including whether they have churned of not. 
The data set includes information about:
+ Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
+ Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
+ Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
+ Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
